## 0. Getting Started

Writing an `R` package is easier than you'd think, but requires a little working knowledge. Your project coordinator (Tim Fraser) has compiled the document skeleton you need to make your `R` package here!

### 0.1 Required Package files

- `README.md`: Package README doc! Edit upon completion to be a clean intro to the package.

- `DESCRIPTION`: Package metadata. You can update this. Leave an extra blank line at the end.

- `NAMESPACE`: don't edit this. List of functions you're importing and exporting. Automatically generated when building the package.

- `/R`: folder containing the functions in your package, each in their own separate script.

- `/man`: folder containing roxygen documentation for your functions. Automatically generated; don't touch this folder.

- `/data`: folder containing any extra data needed to run package. Needs to be saved as `.rds` or `.rdata` files.

- `.Rbuildignore`: a list of files to be ignored when building the package.

- `optimizer_0.1.0.tar.gz`: built package source file! Can update and load this to use your package.

### 0.2 Development Team files

- `workflow.R`: a script demoing your workflow. Really helpful when building the package.

- `dev.R`: a script for building (compiling) your package!

- `/docs`: a folder for any extra markdown tutorials. Ignored when building package.

- `/z`: a folder for putting anything else that doesn't have a clear home. Ignored when building package.

- `commit.R`: a script for quickly committing ALL changes and pushing to github. Use sparingly, but can be helpful.

- `.gitignore`: a file listing any files to be ignored and NOT backed up to github.
